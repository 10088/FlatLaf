FlatLaf - Flat Look and Feel
============================

**FlatLaf** is a modern open-source cross-platform Look and Feel for Java
desktop applications.

It looks mostly "flat" (no shadows or gradients), clean, simple and elegant.
FlatLaf comes with **Light**, **Dark**, **IntelliJ** and **Darcula** themes,
scales on **HiDPI** displays and runs on Java 8 or newer.

The look is heavily inspired by **Darcula** and **IntelliJ** themes from
IntelliJ IDEA 2019.2+ and uses mostly the same colors and icons.
