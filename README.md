FlatLaf - Flat Look and Feel
============================

**FlatLaf** is a modern open-source cross-platform Look and Feel for Java
desktop applications.

It is mostly "flat" (no shadows or gradients), clean, simple and elegant. It
comes with **Light** and **Dark** themes and is made for **HiDPI** displays.

The look is heavily inspired by **Darcula** and **IntelliJ** themes from
IntelliJ IDEA 2019.2+ and uses mostly the same colors and icons.
